## Architecture Overview

### System Design Philosophy

FinanceFlow Pro implements a modular architecture where each major feature exists as an independent module with clear separation of concerns. This approach enables:

- **Independent Development**: Each module can be developed, tested, and deployed independently
- **Performance Optimization**: Code splitting and lazy loading reduce initial bundle size
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries between modules simplify debugging and feature development
- **Scalability**: New features can be added without affecting existing functionality

### Core Module Structure

```
src/components/pages/
├── Dashboard/     # Financial overview and market insights
├── Portfolio/     # Asset allocation and risk management
├── Advisor/       # AI-powered recommendations and consultation
└── Goals/         # Financial goal setting and progress tracking
```

Each module serves a specific business domain while sharing common UI components and utilities through the shared services layer.

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture

#### Component Layer (`src/components/`)
**Purpose**: Implements the user interface and user experience logic.

**Layout Components** (`src/components/layout/`):
- **Header Module**: Global navigation with responsive design and accessibility features
- **Footer Module**: Consistent footer implementation with legal and contact information
- **Why**: Provides consistent navigation and branding across all application states

**UI Components** (`src/components/ui/`):
- **Design System**: Reusable components following atomic design principles
- **Skeleton Loading**: Performance-optimized loading states with shimmer animations
- **Form Components**: Accessible form elements with validation and error handling
- **Why**: Ensures visual consistency and reduces development time for common UI patterns

#### Data Layer (`src/data/`)
**Purpose**: Manages application state and provides type-safe data structures.

**Mock Data System** (`mockData.ts`):
- **Comprehensive Test Data**: Realistic financial scenarios for development and testing
- **TypeScript Interfaces**: Strongly typed data contracts for all modules
- **Validation Logic**: Built-in data validation and transformation utilities
- **Why**: Enables rapid development without external API dependencies while maintaining type safety

#### State Management
**Approach**: React Context and local component state with performance optimizations.

**Performance Strategy**:
- **React.memo**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders of expensive components
- **useMemo**: Caches expensive calculations and data transformations
- **useCallback**: Optimizes event handlers and prevents child re-renders
- **Why**: Maintains smooth 60fps performance on mobile devices while handling complex financial calculations

### Build System Architecture

#### Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)
**Purpose**: Optimizes development experience and production builds.

**Development Optimizations**:
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Instant updates during development
- **Fast Refresh**: State-preserving component updates
- **Source Maps**: Enhanced debugging capabilities
- **Why**: Reduces development cycle time and improves developer productivity

**Production Optimizations**:
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic chunk generation for optimal loading
- **Tree Shaking**: Eliminates unused code from production bundles
- **Minification**: Terser-based minification with console.log removal
- **Why**: Achieves sub-second loading times and optimal caching strategies

#### TypeScript Architecture (`tsconfig.json`)
**Purpose**: Provides type safety and enhanced developer experience.

**Configuration Strategy**:
- **Strict Mode**: Maximum type checking for production-ready code
- **Module Resolution**: ESNext modules with bundler resolution
- **Path Mapping**: Absolute imports for cleaner import statements
- **Why**: Prevents runtime errors and provides excellent IDE support

### Styling Architecture

#### Tailwind CSS System (`tailwind.config.js`)
**Purpose**: Provides utility-first styling with custom design tokens.

**Design Token Strategy**:
- **Color System**: Semantic colors (brand, success, error, warning) with opacity variants
- **Typography Scale**: Responsive font sizing with consistent line heights
- **Spacing System**: 4px base unit with responsive multipliers
- **Why**: Enables rapid UI development while maintaining design consistency

#### Responsive Design Implementation
**Breakpoint System**:
- **Mobile (sm: 640px)**: Single-column layouts with touch-optimized interactions
- **Tablet (md: 768px)**: Two-column layouts with enhanced navigation
- **Desktop (lg: 1024px)**: Multi-column layouts with full feature visibility
- **Large (xl: 1280px)**: Optimized for productivity with expanded component sizing
- **Why**: Provides optimal user experience across all device categories

## Performance Architecture

### Bundle Optimization Strategy

#### Code Splitting Implementation
**Lazy Loading Modules**:
```typescript
// src/App.tsx - Component-based code splitting
const Dashboard = lazy(() => import('./components/pages/Dashboard'));
const Portfolio = lazy(() => import('./components/pages/Portfolio'));
const Advisor = lazy(() => import('./components/pages/Advisor'));
const Goals = lazy(() => import('./components/pages/Goals'));
```

**Why this approach**:
- **Initial Load Time**: Reduces initial bundle size by ~60%
- **Caching Efficiency**: Each module cached independently by browser
- **Development Experience**: No impact on development hot reload
- **Production Performance**: Optimal loading strategy for real-world usage patterns

#### Memory Management
**React Performance Optimizations**:
- **Component Memoization**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders
- **Callback Optimization**: Stable function references prevent child updates
- **Computation Caching**: Expensive calculations cached with useMemo
- **Why**: Maintains smooth 60fps animations on mobile devices

### Accessibility Architecture

#### WCAG 2.1 AA Implementation
**Semantic HTML Structure**:
- **ARIA Labels**: Comprehensive screen reader support
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility with logical tab order
- **Focus Management**: Visible focus indicators with proper contrast ratios
- **Skip Links**: Jump navigation for assistive technology users
- **Why**: Ensures the application is usable by all users regardless of ability

#### Responsive Accessibility
**Touch Target Optimization**:
- **Minimum Size**: 44px touch targets for mobile accessibility
- **Focus Indicators**: High-contrast focus rings for keyboard navigation
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA attributes and live regions
- **Why**: Meets legal accessibility requirements and improves user experience

## Module Development Guidelines

### Component Architecture Patterns

#### Performance-First Development
**React.memo Usage**:
```typescript
// Expensive chart components wrapped with memo
const PortfolioChart = memo(({ data }) => {
  // Chart implementation with expensive calculations
  return <ResponsiveContainer>...</ResponsiveContainer>;
});
```

**Why**: Prevents re-rendering of complex visualizations when parent props haven't changed meaningfully.

#### TypeScript Integration
**Interface-First Development**:
```typescript
interface PortfolioData {
  symbol: string;
  name: string;
  shares: number;
  avgCost: number;
  currentPrice: number;
  marketValue: number;
  gainLoss: number;
  gainLossPercent: number;
  sector: string;
}
```

**Why**: Provides compile-time guarantees and excellent IDE support for data structures.

### State Management Philosophy

#### Local State Management
**Component-Level State**:
- **useState**: For component-specific UI state (active tabs, form inputs)
- **useReducer**: For complex state transitions (multi-step forms, wizard flows)
- **Custom Hooks**: For reusable state logic (form validation, API calls)
- **Why**: Maintains encapsulation and prevents unnecessary re-renders

#### Performance State
**Memoized Calculations**:
```typescript
// Expensive calculations cached to prevent recalculation
const portfolioMetrics = useMemo(() => ({
  totalValue: holdings.reduce((sum, holding) => sum + holding.marketValue, 0),
  topPerformer: holdings.reduce((best, current) =>
    current.gainLossPercent > best.gainLossPercent ? current : best
  ),
  diversificationScore: calculateDiversificationScore(holdings)
}), [holdings]);
```

**Why**: Optimizes performance by avoiding expensive recalculations on every render.

## Deployment Architecture
