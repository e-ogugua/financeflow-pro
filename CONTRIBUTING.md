# Contributing Guidelines

## Development Workflow

### Prerequisites

Before contributing to FinanceFlow Pro, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js 18+**: For package management and build tools
- **npm or yarn**: Package manager (npm recommended)
- **Git**: Version control system
- **Modern IDE**: VS Code, WebStorm, or similar with TypeScript support

### Project Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/e-ogugua/financeflow-pro.git
   cd financeflow-pro
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` if environment variables are needed
   - Configure any API keys or external service credentials
   - Set up local development database if required

4. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Visit `http://localhost:5173` to verify the application loads
   - Check browser console for any errors or warnings

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards

#### TypeScript Usage
- **Strict Mode**: All files must compile without TypeScript errors
- **Interface Definition**: Define interfaces for all data structures
- **Type Safety**: Avoid `any` types; use specific types or generics
- **Component Props**: Define prop interfaces for all React components

#### React Best Practices
- **Functional Components**: Use functional components with hooks
- **Custom Hooks**: Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- **Performance Optimization**: Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback appropriately
- **Accessibility**: Include ARIA labels, roles, and keyboard navigation

#### Styling Guidelines
- **Tailwind CSS**: Use utility classes for styling
- **Custom CSS**: Only for animations and complex effects
- **Responsive Design**: Implement mobile-first responsive design
- **Design Tokens**: Use consistent colors, spacing, and typography

### Component Architecture

#### File Organization
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── layout/          # Header, Footer, Navigation
│   ├── pages/           # Main application pages
│   └── ui/              # Reusable UI components
├── data/                # Mock data and type definitions
├── utils/               # Utility functions and helpers
└── hooks/               # Custom React hooks
```

#### Naming Conventions
- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `Dashboard.tsx`, `PortfolioCard.tsx`)
- **Utilities**: camelCase (e.g., `formatCurrency.ts`, `calculateRisk.ts`)
- **Types**: PascalCase with suffix (e.g., `PortfolioData.ts`, `MarketIndicators.ts`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_CASE (e.g., `API_ENDPOINTS.ts`, `COLORS.ts`)

### Performance Requirements

#### Bundle Size Management
- **Main Bundle Target**: ≤120kB (currently ~420kB with optimizations in progress)
- **Code Splitting**: Use React.lazy() for page components
- **Tree Shaking**: Ensure unused code is eliminated in production builds
- **Asset Optimization**: Compress images and use appropriate formats

#### Animation Performance
- **GPU Acceleration**: Use transform and opacity properties only
- **Reduced Motion**: Respect user's motion preferences
- **Frame Rate**: Maintain 60fps on mobile devices
- **Memory Usage**: Minimize animation-related memory consumption

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
```bash
# Run unit tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode during development
npm run test:watch

# Generate test coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

**Testing Guidelines**:
- **Component Testing**: Test all component props and state changes
- **Hook Testing**: Verify custom hook behavior and side effects
- **Utility Testing**: Test helper functions and calculations
- **Accessibility Testing**: Verify ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation

### Integration Testing
```bash
# Run integration tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:e2e -- --grep "dashboard"
```

**Integration Test Coverage**:
- User workflows (navigation, form submission, data display)
- Component interactions (parent-child communication)
- External API integration (when implemented)
- Error handling and edge cases

### Performance Testing
```bash
# Run Lighthouse performance audit
npx lighthouse http://localhost:5173 --output json --output-path ./performance-report.json

# Bundle analyzer
npm run build:analyze
```

**Performance Metrics**:
- **First Contentful Paint**: < 1.5s
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: < 2.5s
- **Cumulative Layout Shift**: < 0.1
- **First Input Delay**: < 100ms

## Build Process

### Development Build
```bash

```

### Build Configuration

#### Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)
- **Development Mode**: Fast refresh, source maps, development optimizations
- **Production Mode**: Code splitting, minification, tree shaking
- **Bundle Analysis**: Chunk separation for vendor, charts, and animations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Bundle size warnings and compression reporting

#### TypeScript Configuration (`tsconfig.json`)
